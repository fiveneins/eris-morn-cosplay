# Cosplaying Eris Morn - Arduino

Creating a wearable microcontroller project for Halloween to cosplay Eris Morn from the game Destiny. 

## Motivation

This is my first wearables project and cosplay. This project will familiarize me with wiring using conductive thread, power regulation, and programming in languages that I'm less familiar with. I also hope that this will prove helpful to other people who are interested but hesitant in working with LEDs in wearable projects.
